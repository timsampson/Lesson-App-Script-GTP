# Activity Plan and Slides Builder

## With GPT3 and Google Apps Script (GAPS)

As a summer project I wanted to get some experience with LLMs and see how they might help provide some content for lesson activities for CS subjects.

After many iterations and starting with simple prompts and lots of copy and pasting, I have a workflow that works consistently with a minimum amount of input while providing activity documents and lesson step slides will help add value to lesson delivery in class.
